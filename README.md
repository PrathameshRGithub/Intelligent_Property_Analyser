# Intelligent_Property_Analyser
The "Intelligent Property Analyser" project is a comprehensive and versatile data science and machine learning endeavor designed to help users accurately estimate the prices of residential properties. The model is built using Random Forest algorithm with 0.97 r2 score.
The objective of this project is to develop a ML powered system using Python centric libraries to accomplish the following:
1. To predict the approximate price of a housing property based on multiple factors related to the property.
2. Design a Web UI for users to access the system and feed data related to the property for analysis.
3. Design end-to-end ML based system that would be trained with sufficient dataset to accomplish the task with acceptable accuracy.
